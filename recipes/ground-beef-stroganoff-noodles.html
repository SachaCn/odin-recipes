    <h3>These ground beef stroganoff noodles are a shortcut version of classic beef stroganoff in a one-pan version. The ultimate comfort food with flavorful ground beef, mushrooms, and egg noodles.</h3>
    <p>Like most people who grew up during the Golden Age of processed food, my mom bought a fair amount of pre-packaged, pre-mixed, just-add-water type meals, but when it came to pasta or noodles in a ground meat sauce, her hamburger did not need any help. We did enjoy the occasional box of mac and cheese, or package of pop-tarts, but virtually all dishes like this ground beef stroganoff noodles were made from scratch.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vodka (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups beef broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups egg noodles</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh sliced chives or green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, season with salt, and saute, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Add onion and ground beef. Cook, stirring, until meat is browned and crumbly, and onions turn soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with black pepper and cayenne.</li>
        <li>Stir in minced garlic and flour, and cook for 1 minute. Pour in vodka and allow to evaporate, about 30 seconds. Stir in beef broth and water and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium, and mix in noodles. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover and stir thoroughly. Cover again and cook until noodles are just tender, about 3 minutes. (See Cook's Note.)

        </li>
        <li>Once noodles are cooked, reduce heat to low, and stir in sour cream. Serve immediately with additional sour cream and green onions or chives if so desired.</li>
    </ol>
